Great question — let's break down **exactly what the retrieval script did** step by step:

---

## 🔍 What `retrieve.py` Did

### 1. **Loaded your vector database**

```python
db = Chroma(...)
```

* This opened the `./chroma_db` folder, where all your embedded tasks (from `agenda.txt`) are stored.
* Each item in that DB includes:

  * The embedded vector of the task text
  * Metadata: like `fecha` (date), `etiquetas` (tags like `"urgente"`, `"pendiente"`)

---

### 2. **Prepared a query**

```python
query_agenda("urgent tasks", filter_by={"etiquetas": "urgente"})
```

You asked:

> Find agenda items similar to **"urgent tasks"**, but **only** those with the tag `urgente`.

---

### 3. **Generated an embedding for your query**

```python
embedding = OllamaEmbeddings(model="mxbai-embed-large")
```

* The phrase `"urgent tasks"` was embedded into a vector using the same model (`mxbai-embed-large`) used to embed the agenda items.

---

### 4. **Searched the database**

```python
results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=top_k, filter=filter_by)
```

* Chroma compared the query vector to all stored task vectors.
* It selected the **top `k` most similar ones** (based on cosine similarity).
* It **applied your metadata filter**: `{"etiquetas": "urgente"}`.

---

### 5. **Printed results**

```python
print(f"📄 Text: {doc.page_content}")
print(f"🗂️ Metadata: {doc.metadata}")
```

For each match, you got:

* The **original task** (like "Urgente: revisar inventario…")
* Its **metadata** (like `"fecha": "2025-05-27"` and `"etiquetas": ["urgente"]`)
* A **score** indicating how semantically similar the result is to your query

---

### 🧪 Example (What it might print)

```
🔎 Query: urgent tasks

Result 1 (Score: 0.2112)
📄 Text: Urgente: renovar tarjeta identificativa antes de que caduque
🗂️ Metadata: {'fecha': '2025-05-27', 'etiquetas': ['urgente']}
```

---

### ✅ TL;DR

You semantically searched your `agenda.txt`, filtered by `"urgente"`, and retrieved the most relevant tasks — using embeddings, not keyword matching.

Would you like to:

* 💡 Add **date filters**?
* 🧑‍💻 Build a simple UI or API for querying?
* 🔄 Convert more files like `agenda.txt` into vectorized notes?

Just let me know.
