Absolutely! Here's a clear, structured summary of everything we built — broken down by file — showing what each part does in your RAG system.

### 📁 Project Summary: File-by-File Overview

| 📄 File Path                       | 🧠 Purpose                                                                 | 🔧 Key Functions                      |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `project/data/agenda.txt`          | Raw input file with agenda items (tasks, reminders, notes)                 | N/A                                   |
| `project/processing/preprocess.py` | Cleans and structures raw agenda lines into dictionaries with metadata     | `preprocess_agenda()`                 |
| `project/embeddings/embed.py`      | Converts structured tasks into vector embeddings and stores them in Chroma | `embed_agenda()`                      |
| `project/retrieval/retrieve.py`    | Performs semantic search queries with optional metadata filters            | `query_agenda()`                      |
| `run/main.py`                      | Central runner that preprocesses, embeds if needed, and enters query loop  | `build_vectorstore()`, `query_loop()` |

### 🔗 How These Files Work Together

| Flow Step            | Description                                                                       | Involved Files  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 🧹 **Preprocessing** | Reads `agenda.txt`, extracts `texto`, `fecha`, `etiquetas`                        | `preprocess.py` |
| 🧠 **Embedding**     | Uses `mxbai-embed-large` via Ollama to embed the cleaned tasks                    | `embed.py`      |
| 💾 **Storage**       | Saves those vectors in a persistent Chroma DB with metadata attached              | `embed.py`      |
| 🔍 **Retrieval**     | Loads the DB and returns the most semantically relevant tasks for any input query | `retrieve.py`   |
| 🚀 **Main Runner**   | Automates the full process and starts a live terminal-based query loop            | `main.py`       |

### ✅ Result

You now have a working **local RAG system** where you can:

* Ingest and preprocess any unstructured agenda
* Embed and store it with rich metadata
* Query it using semantic search and filters like `"urgente"` or by date

---

Would you like to:

* Add a UI (e.g. Gradio)?
* Add JSON/Markdown export?
* Schedule updates (e.g. cron jobs)?

Let me know how you'd like to expand!
